# Contact Us Form Application

I have developed a simple Contact Us Form application that enables users to submit their inquiries. This application performs input validation, stores submissions in a MySQL database, and sends email notifications using PHPMailer.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   Start by cloning this repository to your local machine using the following command:
    git clone https://github.com/kaushalnbt/contact-us-form.git


2. **Create the Database:**
Open your MySQL database management tool and create a new database named `contactus_form`, i created this because an already `contact_form` placed in my db you can create `contact_form`.

3. **Import the Database Schema:**
In the repository's root directory, locate the `contactus_form.sql` file. Import this SQL file into your `contactus_form` database. This step will create the necessary table structure.

4. **Configure Database Connection:**
Open the `process_form.php` file in a text editor. Locate the database connection details section and update them to match your configuration:
```php
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "root";
$password = "";
$dbname = "contact_form";

Configure SMTP for Email Sending:
$phpmailer->Host = 'your-smtp';
$phpmailer->SMTPAuth = true;
$phpmailer->Port = 2525;
$phpmailer->Username = 'your-mailtrap-username';
$phpmailer->Password = 'your-mailtrap-password';

Install PHPMailer Dependencies:
    
    composer install
    composer require phpmailer/phpmailer

After these Steps Run the Application:
- Please open a web browser and access the URL of the contact_form.html file located in the repository. for mine "localhost/htdocs/mywebsite" Complete the contact form and submit it. The form data will be validated, stored in the database, and an email notification will be dispatched.

Additional Notes:
-The contact_form.html file contains the HTML structure of the form.
-The style.css file holds the external CSS styles for the form's appearance.
-The process_form.php file manages form submission, validation, database insertion, and email transmission.
